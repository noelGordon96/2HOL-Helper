Description:

This program provides background QOL utilities to help when playing 2HOL. This includes easily opening up the online crafting guide as well as quickly creating timers for in-game tasks.


Compatability:
- Windows 11
- Windown 10 (most likely)
- Not sure about older Windows versions, Apple, or Linux, sorry :(


Installation:

- Download  and unzip the "2HOL-Helper.zip" file and copy the resulting folder somewhere on your system
- Double click the "setup.exe" file and navigate to and select your 2HOL game folder
	* (Where this is on your system will depend on where it was placed when 2HOL was first installed, it is the folder that contains your "OneLife.exe" file. The folder name should look something like "2HOL_v220515164250" unless the name was changed manually when it was installed.)
- You can then decide if you would like a desktop or start menu shortcut to the to 2HOL Helper program, click "Finish" and you are good to go
- When you are ready to play 2HOL open the "2HOL Helper.exe" file to launch your game (or use one of the shortcuts you may have created above).
- Your first time opening, you may want to take a look at the program settings (see section below) to make sure the timer position and sound settings are to your liking.


Uninstallation:

- This program requires no special procedures to uninstall. Simply deleting the folder and shortcuts will remove the program and all its settings from your computer. (Deleting the 2HOL-Helper folder will not affect your regular 2HOL game.)
