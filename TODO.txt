TODO ITEMS
-----------------------------------------------------------

- Convert entire project to AHK V2

  - Add indicator for script chat status (better for future testing to improve chat tracking)
    (I will need to rework the GUI creation for this (V2 will make this easier)
    - If timer is running: Turn timer text red as indicator
    - If timer is off: Use timer window to display "- chat -" in red (or something similar)
 
  - Add option to trigger script hotkeys only with modifiers (this will avoid all chat tracking issues, for those who might frequently have issues)

- Have option to open settings after "setup.exe" is complete

- Remove AHK file to separate source folder

- (In Setup.exe) Move 2HOL folder connection into shortcuts GUI for cleaner feel

- Add help.txt file and about section to menu

- Make timer transparent when dragging timer




POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS
-----------------------------------------------------------

- FEATURE enable multiple timers to go at once




FIX KNOWN BUGS
-----------------------------------------------------------

- BUG FIX chat tracking is not always accurate particularly when entering and exiting the menu
          (ex. exiting the menu with ENTER will cause the script to think chat window is active)
          Current workaround in to just press ESC a couple times, this will ensure the script and game chat status are the same

- BUG FIX typing in the main menu spawn seed field can activate hotkeys (current workaround: pause hotkeys)

- BUG FIX try to solve full-screen limitation (timer not always displayed over a full screen game)
  (borderless currently works best to avoid window being minimized when setting timer, still might not always work on all systems)

- BUG FIX script will not exit until timer is finished (also timer can't be canceled after window closed)
